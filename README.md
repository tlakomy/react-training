# react-training

# What's that?
Those are the lessons/example which I used at my "Introduction to React" lecture at [Pozna≈Ñ University of Technology](https://www.facebook.com/pg/put.net/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1536854639682559)

FYI: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# How do I run it?
1. `npm install -g yarn` (You can use `npm` if you want, that's fine)
2. Run `yarn` (or `npm install`)
3. `npm start`/`yarn start`
4. Go to `http:/localhost:3000` in your favorite browser
